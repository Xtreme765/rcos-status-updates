## Last Week's Accomplishments

Documentation is complete, I've tied up loose ends on projects I was working on like 
getting the settings screen layout complete. Other parts of the app I was working on 
as well as other android features will be postponed to next semester's RCOS.

## This Week's Plan

Studying for finals, wish me luck.

## Anything Blocking?

How many people we can get in next year's RCOS.
