## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've added an Action Bar to the top of the app and added a Settings Button on it. The settings 
button opens a settings page I created. I added a switch to toggle Data Analytics on and off, 
the actual funtionality of turning Data Analytics on and off is not yet implemented. I also 
added placeholder text on the Settings page for the version and build number.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on replacing the placeholder for the version and build number with the actual number 
by implementing a method that will grab these numbers on launch and display them on the 
settings page. I'll also be looking into giving the Data Analytics some funtionality and 
adding any other Settings features I can implement.

## Anything Blocking?

Some of the existing code doesn't mesh well with code I try to add. I tried implementing 
a custom Toolbar in place of the Action bar but it wouldn't display properly because of 
the existing calendar that is displayed. With some more experience I'll figure out how to 
adjust the layout properly. I've also had lots of work getting in the way but I was still 
able to implement these things despite of it.
