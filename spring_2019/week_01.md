## Last Week's Accomplishments

I was able to learn how navigate and familiarize myself with Android Studio so that I can 
eventually make significant contributions to the Android version of the RushMe application
that is currently in development. I've also successfully run the current groundwork code
of the application on my android device.

## This Week's Plan

After having familiarized myself with the ins and outs of Android studio I plan on adding icons
to the Android version of the RushMe app after learning how to do so in general. I also plan on
becoming more familiar with the code that we already in place.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I'm having trouble figuring out layout of the groundwork that has already been set for the RushMe app
and will need to ask for a tour of the current code from whomever put it together. My laptop tends
to obscure the Android Studio interface compared to my Desktop making it a bit harder to navigate.
