## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've updated our ReadMe to reflect all of the Java classes in our code with a description and source. 
I've updated our To-Do list and implemented a sidebar in my version of the code which will not be 
making it into the main code due to use moving away from the sidebar on both versions of the app. 
I've updated our banner and icon on the Google Play store to more accurately reflect the app and 
so that it's in line with the IOS version.

## This Week's Plan

More clean-up to prepare for our presentation. I will also be contributing to the Android slides
of our presentation to reflect what we've done so far and where we plan on going. I'll be hacking 
away at solutions for additional features in the Android app.

## Anything Blocking?

Not much blocking anymore, I've got a solid understanding of our existing code, I know exactly 
what we have on Google Play and what the current state of our app is. The project is coming 
along smoothly and should be in a presentable state for our presentation.
