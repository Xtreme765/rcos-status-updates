## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've commented more of our existing code and have done extensive research into how we are publishing 
our app to the Google Play store. I've joined our Google Play console account so that I can publish 
when we have a functional version ready. I've added random sidebars and other aspects to a local 
version of the application in order to get a better feel for adding things to app.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on finishing fully commenting the codebase, as well as fixing up other aspects of our Android 
application that aren't working (time will tell just how much needs to be fixed). If we make enough 
progress I might be the one publishing the the first version of the Android application by the end
of the week.

## Anything Blocking?

Surprisingly less roadblocks than I thought, I was told that publishing on the Apple App store 
was a difficult task for the others and so I went in fully prepared for a struggle with Google Play.
As it turns out, publishing to Google Play is a lot easier than publishing to Apple's App store 
according to all of the sources I've learned my information from. My newness to project is still 
a rather big roadblock but I'm overcoming most of what's stopped me as I learn more and more about 
app development.
