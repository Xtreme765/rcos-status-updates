## Last Week's Accomplishments

Android studio is a lot more familar for me now after having implemented various interface elements to
mimic what we have on IOS version of our app. I understand a bit more of our IOS code but am still
unfamiliar with some elements that need to be translated over.

## This Week's Plan

Mostly the same as last week, I'll be working more on the interface and will most likely be finalizing
some elements of the app in order to hopefully meet our deadline by the end of the semester.

## Anything Blocking?

The newest block for me is translating what code and interface details we have on IOS to Android studio.
I will be asking questions related to the how our IOS app functions in order to gain greater insight
into how to approach putting together the Android app.
