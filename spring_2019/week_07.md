## Last Week's Accomplishments

We've finally published a beta version of our app to Google Play. The process was met with a few 
bumps on the road when we tried to upload our signed APK in release mode but luckily we overcame 
that hurdle. I've also created a feature graphic, a banner, and have cleaned up some screenshots for 
the beta release.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on fixing up any current issues we have with the beta release as well as looking over all of 
the Google Play details to make sure we are on board for a successful release in the future. I will 
be adding any bits and pieces to app that I can to make it similar and eventually the same as the 
IOS version.

## Anything Blocking?

The switch from debug to release mode is still a bit confusing to me in regards to errors that appear 
when we do so. I still get a bit lost on pinpointing where many errors are located due to there being 
calls to graphical assets and functions that the rest of the team had developed on the IOS version.
