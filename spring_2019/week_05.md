## Last Week's Accomplishments

I had a nice Spring Break being able to go back home over break. I was unable to get work done due to 
not having access to my Desktop computer which is where I get all of my work done as well as where I 
push my status updates from. 

## This Week's Plan

As we get closer to the end of the month we plan on having a working version of RushMe for Android. At 
the moment we have a solid basis for the app, I've commented a decent amount of the current code and I 
am currently putting together other aspects of the app such as a working sidebar and the pages that 
correspond to this sidebar.

## Anything Blocking?

My knowledge of Android development that I've developed over the semester is still not enough to be 
proficient in finalizing aspects of the app. Also, my understanding of the original code on IOS is 
low and translating these aspects of the IOS app to android has proven rather difficult.
