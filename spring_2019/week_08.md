## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've added an animated splash screen to our app that loads upon startup of the app. I've also updated
the ReadMe to list the classes that are implemented in our code as well as a To-Do section that I 
will be contantly updating to list exactly what is missing from the Android version compared to the 
IOS version of our App.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on finally getting the left sidebar to work. I also plan on detailing what exactly each of our 
classes does by adding comments straight to GitHub. I'll be adding any other parts of the app that 
I am able to implement. I will be cleaning up the project so that it is ready to be presented by 
April 9th.

## Anything Blocking?

As I touched on in my plan this week, the implementation of the left sidebar has been a difficult 
one due to the implementations I've tried failing to work with our current code. I've created a 
sidbar similar to our IOS version in a new project but getting this code implemented into the 
existing project has been troublesome. I'll be trying more implementations this week until one 
eventually works.
