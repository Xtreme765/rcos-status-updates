## Last Week's Accomplishments

We've presented in small group and big group which went fairly well. I've been hacking 
away at more features like favoriting fraternities, prompting users on first startup 
to accept terms and conditions, and adding more to our settings pane.

## This Week's Plan

Finalizing all documentation is the number one priority so that those who join the 
project next semester can pick up where a lot of members will leave off. I also plan on 
finishing up any features I am in the middle of adding like those listed above. I will 
also clean up our beta listing on the Google Play store to make it more presentable 
for those who find it.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing really blocking progress at the moment, it's pretty much smooth sailing with 
tying up loose ends, unless these loose ends turn out to be hard to tie together.

## Notes

I confused myself on whether I uploaded a duplicated status update or not, it turns 
out that this was not the case. When going down the status update history I became 
confused with my reverting status update for week 07 and upon further inspection 
it seems I mis-titled the push description it and immediately reverted it to week 08.
Sorry for any confusion.
