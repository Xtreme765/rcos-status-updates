## Last Week's Accomplishments

We've presented in small group and big group which went fairly well. I've been hacking 
away at more features like favoriting fraternities, prompting users on first startup 
to accept terms and conditions, and adding more to our settings pane.

## This Week's Plan

Finalizing all documentation is the number one priority so that those who join the 
project next semester can pick up where a lot of members will leave off. I also plan on 
finishing up any features I am in the middle of adding like those listed above. I will 
also clean up our beta listing on the Google Play store to make it more presentable 
for those who find it.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing really blocking progress at the moment, it's pretty much smooth sailing with 
tying up loose ends, unless these loose ends turn out to be hard to tie together.

## Notes

I created a separate .md file detailing this but I'll write it again here just in case:
I accidently uploaded week 07 a second time with the name as week 08 a few weeks back.
My numbering is slightly ahead of where it should be at but the intervals at which
they were uploaded has remained consistent. To clarify, week 09 is actually week 08,
week 10 is week 09, and week 11 is week 10. Hope this doesn't create too much
confusion and sorry for the trouble.
