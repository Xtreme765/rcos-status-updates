## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've finally fixed most of the issues I've had with getting my laptop to correctly run aspects of
Android Studio such as showing the Design/Layout of the app which it had trouble with. I've also
successfully implemented icons into our Android project in order to mirror what we have in the IOS version.

## This Week's Plan

Now that I've implemented icons and am even more accustomed with Android Studio, I plan on helping implement
parts of the interface and work on most of the front-end details of the app overall.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm still fairly new to app development in general so most roadblocks are those that I will encounter when tryting
to implement various aspects of the app for the first time. So far there are no major roadblocks other than my
laptop being slow but still usable for app development.
