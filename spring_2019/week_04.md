## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've updated the public app icon of our app to show the same icon that we use on IOS. It is now updated
to be adaptable to all types of phones with it having additional rounded options, along with different
scales to fit any interface. I've started to add comments to our existing code in order to understand
it as a decipher what our intentions were for every aspect of it.

## This Week's Plan

I might now get very much done during Spring Break but if I get the chance I will continue working on
commenting all of our code as well as experimenting with adding some of the elements of the app that
are on the IOS version such as the calendar details, the side-bar, and possibly other menus as well.

## Anything Blocking?

Not as many things blocking me as before. I've learned to pace myself correctly as well as to keep up 
to date with any new activities we need completed on our Trello Board. I expect that in the next half 
of the semester I will be proficient enough to create elements of the app from scratch to eventually
make an app almost indistinguishable from its IOS counterpart.
